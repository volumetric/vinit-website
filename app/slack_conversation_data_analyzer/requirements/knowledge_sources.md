I want to create something called knowledge base that will have a specific type of data source. here are some examples of data sources:

1. Website: HTML page content of one, some or all the pages of a website. Could range from 1-10,000 pages. This will be done through crawling the pages of a website, so there is also page linking information. Which page is available as an anchor link in which other pages. So, it will be good to have that information retained as well.
2. Documents: PDF, Doc(x), PPT(x), TXT, and Markdown. These documents can possibly be provided in some folder structure, like in file system with different folders and files and some strcutre to the files, or all the files could be in the same folder itself. So, it will be good to have that information retained as well.
3. Q&A Pairs: A list of Question and Answer pair text. This can be in the range of 1-10,000 Q&A Pairs.
4. Keep information about images.
