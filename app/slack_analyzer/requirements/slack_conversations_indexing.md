For the conversations shown in the channels tab, apart from the current display, add a simple mode, and add it as a toggle at the top of the conversation pane. turning it on should show each conversation thread in simple mardown format or plain text. Remove any extra `@` symbol in front of the names and put a colon after the user's name and before their message. e.g.

Vinit Agrawal: Hello, how are you





I see that the user_id is not replaced with the user's name in some messages, I am not sure why. it is being replaced in other message corresctly. can you fix that.

There is an @ symbol that is added as prefix for all the user's names, please remove it from all the user's names.

The reply messages in a conversation thread is showing in a different container in the UI. don't do that just put everything in the same container and keep the text one after another. one single markdown text.
