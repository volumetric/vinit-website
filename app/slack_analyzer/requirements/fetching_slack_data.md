@Slack Docs

I want to fetch all the message data, sent by anyone in the team, on a given slack channel. I also can give the date range for which the data needs to be fetch from. if not givem use it to past 30 days from today.

I not only want to fetch all the message data, but also organize them into coherent conversation. One way to organize this data is to fetch all the messages from a single slack thread and turn them into a single conversation document.

please look at the slack documentation and help me understand the APIs that are needed to fetch this data and also the messages can be organized in the conversation document, with all the messages from a single slack thread are saved in a single conversation document.

Keep all the metadata for each individual message as it is but organize the messages into conversation documents that belongs to a single Slack thread.
