# Raw Requirements Blurb by the User/Maker

Please suggest a good strategy that I can use to collate, split and embed the slack conversations text data, happening in a saas company of size 30 people.

This overall indexing strategy should help me (as a founder of that saas company) understand what is going on in our slack  workspace, what kind of things people are talking about, what kinds of product updates we are releasing, what kinds of bugs and issues are being reported, what kind of marketing activities we are doing, what new features we are building, etc.

Assume there is a separate slack channel for different broad discussion topics like above and mostly discussions are happening in slack threads, but not always.

Please take a deep breath, and think step by step, and give all the details of how to collate slack message data into coherent conversations, how to split it, which embedding model to use to convert it into vectors, maybe have multiple vector representation to get the essence of the conversation topic at different levels, etc.

Please think deeply about it, do a deep research on it and give me the best strategy to do this with proper reasoning.

Thankyou

## Implementation Strategy Notes

For initial development, focus on the Priority Requirement DSL, which includes:

1. **Basic data collection** from public Slack channels
2. **Conversation reconstruction** for coherent conversation units
3. **Vector embeddings** for semantic understanding
4. **Topic analysis** for content categorization
5. **Simple search interface** for finding relevant discussions
6. **Basic insights dashboard** for visualization and interaction
7. **Core privacy and security** to protect sensitive data

This approach allows you to:
- Get a functional system faster
- Validate the overall approach before extensive development
- Start getting value from conversation analysis
- Gather user feedback for future iterations

Once the initial system is working, you can progressively implement more requirements from the Full Requirement DSL based on user feedback and business needs.
