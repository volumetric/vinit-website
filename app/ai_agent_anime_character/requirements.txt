Make a simple app where I upload an image of a face, of a cartoon or an anime kind of character's face and it can give me different facial expressions of that face like happy, sad and even possibly even lip sync on some text. It can give me lip sync based real time video feed of that thing based on something I ask it as a prompt. So if I ask it, that give me a happy expression, it should smile and if I say this thing in some double quotes, give some text, it should say that word in a lip sync manner. And if I say something, some more instructions later on that saying this way, it should do that as well. So yeah, you can do it by finding some library which controls the facial expression of the image of a face and then based on some predefined facial expression presets, it just gives a command to change the facial expression. We start with that and let's not have anything prompt per se like AI is something like that. It can just simply just have some basic expression and if I give a prompt, it should, if I make a request, it should change that expression.
