        "On July 1st, 2010, the \"Attack of the Killer App\" episode aired during season six of the animated sitcom Futurama. In the episode, the company Mom Industries releases the eyePhone, a parody of the Apple iPhone. When the protagonist Fry attempts to purchase one at a store, he is warned by the cashier about reception and battery life issues to which he interrupts yelling \"Shut up and take my money!\" while waving several dollar bills (shown at the 26-second mark below).",
        "The following day, the German tech blog Crackajack[4] published a post about the episode and included an image macro of Fry with the caption \"Shut up and take my money!\"",
