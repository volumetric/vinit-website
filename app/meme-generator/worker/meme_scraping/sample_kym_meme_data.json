                "Although the etymology of \"baka\" remains uncertain, some speculate that the word \"baka\" was first used in Chinese literature as early as in 246 B.C. However, the earliest known written usage of \"baka\" on record can be traced to an excerpt from the traditional historical epic Taiheiki which denotes bakamono (馬鹿者) being used as an insult in 1342 during the Nanboku-chō period (1336–1392) and the civil unrest between the Northern and Southern Courts. The definition of baka that is used today was thought to be used around 1663-1733, from the Sanskrit meaning “foolish.”[1]"

Also being the name of popular anime and songs; such as Baka to Test to Shōkanjū and Triple Baka. Multiple definitions of the word have been uploaded by users of Urban Dictionary since 2003.[2]",

Images of animals and people alike that have been manipulated with Photoshop to have anime-style eyes and blushes are associated with these phrases."
